Device: console
===============

Device ID:   0x1000
Device name: "console"

The console device is always present for the user, and allows for communication
to the outside world using a simple terminal. Writing a single byte to the
device will immediately transfer it to the native device, unless the byte is
17d / 11h. Then the console drops into control mode, where you can get meta
data from the device. After sending 0x11 & the control code, the next n bytes
the user reads will be the response.


Control codes
-------------

CCTL_SIZE   0x1
    Returns two words (u16[2]) which are the width & height of the terminal,
    respectively.



Examples
--------

Getting the terminal width & height could look something like this:

    mov r0, 0x20        ; write
    mov r1, 0x1000      ; console device ID

    mov h2, 0x11        ; console control mode
    cpucall
    mov h2, 0x01        ; CCTL_SIZE
    cpucall

    mov r0, 0x21        ; read

    cpucall             ; get the high byte
    mov h3, h2
    cpucall             ; get the low byte
    mov l3, h2

    mov r4, r3          ; the terminal width is now in r4.

    cpucall             ; get the high byte
    mov h3, h2
    cpucall             ; get the low byte
    mov l3, h2

    mov r5, r3          ; the terminal height is now in r5.
