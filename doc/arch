Irid architecture
=================

Irid is a 16-bit architecture with a simple instruction layout. Each instruction
is always 4 bytes wide. For 255 unique instructions which is more than enough.
Any bytes after that are just data. For example, the basic `mov` instruction
takes a value in a register and copies it into a location in memory, or the
other way around. One byte is used for `mov`, one for the register ID (for a max
of 255 registers), and two bytes for the address (each address takes 16 bits).

The CPU starts by setting all registers to 0, and jumping to 0x0000 - starting
execution there.

Registers
---------

r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7  General purpose registers (16 bit)
h0, h1, h2, h3, l0, l1, l2, l3  Half registers (8 bit)
ip, sp, bp                      Instruction pointer, stack pointer, base pointer
cf, zf, of, sf                  Compare, zero, overflow, shutdown flag


The 8 general purpose registers may be used freely to store data, and in
instructions that take a register as a parameter. The 3 pointer registers are
used by the "cpu" and the push/pop, call & ret instructions.

There are 8 half registers, which are each 8 bits wide. There are made for
single byte stack operations. These registers are actually part of the general
registers, which means the r0 register can be accessed using h0 or l0. Registers
prefixed with h contain the high byte (the first byte), and l the low byte.

Because this is a little-endian architecture, the general registers store the
number the other way around. For example, mov'ing 0x5511 into r0 will set h0
to 0x11 and l0 to 0x55.

The instruction pointer (ip) points to the currently executed instruction in
memory. If this is modified, the program will jump to the address ip points to
and start executing code there. This may cause a instruction fault, so it is not
recommended to change it by hand, using rather the jmp/call/ret instruction
group.

The compare flag (cf), the zero flag (zf), and the overflow flag (of) are all
1 bit wide, storing the result of a comparison, null check or an integer
overflow.

Instruction set
---------------

* Stack operations
    - push [rx/hx/imm8/imm16]
        Push a register/immediate onto the stack, decrementing the stack
        pointer.
    - pop [rx/hx]
        Pop a value off the stack into a register.

* Memory/register operations
    - mov [rx/hx] [rz/hz/imm8/imm16]
        Move a register/immediate into the register.
    - load [rx/hx] [rx]
        Load contents of memory pointed by [rx] to [rx/hx].
    - store [rx/hx] [rx]
        Store contents of [rx/hx] to the address pointed by [rx].
    - null [rx/hx]
        Set a register to 0.

* Comparison operations
    - cmp [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        Compare the value stored in a register to another register or
        an immediate. If the comparison succeeds, the compare flag is set.
    - cmg [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        See if the value in the register is greater than the register or
        immediate. If the comparison succeeds, the compare flag is set.
    - cml [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        See if the value in the register is less than the register or
        immediate. If the comparison succeeds, the compare flag is set.

* Program control
    - jmp [addr]
        Unconditionally jump to the given address.
    - jnz [rx] [addr]
        Jump to the given address, if [rx] is not zero.
    - jeq [addr]
        Jump to the given address, if the compare flag is set.
    - call [rx/addr]
        Jump to the given address, and push the current address so the CPU
        can return from the called subroutine.
    - ret
        Return from a function, popping some data off the stack.
    - cpucall
        Let the CPU execute a function specified by the r0 register. See the
        "CPU call" section.
    - rti
        Return from an interrupt.

* Integer operations
    - add [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        Add an immediate or register to a register.
    - sub [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        Subtract an immediate or register from a register.
    - mul [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        Multiply an immediate or register by [rx], storing the result in [rx].
    - and [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        Logical AND two registers, storing the result in [rx].
    - or [rx] [rz/imm8/imm16]
        Logical OR two registers, storing the result in [rx].
    - not [rx]
        Logical NOT a register.
    - shr [rx] [rz/imm8]
        Shift a value in the register right, filling with zeroes.
    - shl [rx] [rz/imm8]
        Shift a value in the register left, filling with zeroes.

* Interrupts
    - sti
        Set CPU interrupts.
    - dsi
        Disable CPU interrupts.


Memory layout
-------------

On launch, the CPU creates an empty memory layout. You may modify ranges of
memory to interface with external devices using a cpucall. Because this is
a 16-bit architecture, there is a maximum of 64kB of memory. All memory is
split into 64 pages, each being 1kB (1024 or 2^10 bytes) in size.


Calling convention
------------------

The Irid calling convention defines caller registers & callee registers. This
means that some registers have to be stored be the caller, because the called
subroutine may trash them.

Caller-saved    r0, r1, r2, r3, ip, flags
Callee-saved    r4, r5, r6, r7, sp, bp

Arguments       r0, r1, r2, r3
Return value    r0

r3, which is a callee-saved instruction means that it has to preserved for the
caller. In this example, r3 is ensured to be the same after and before the call.

    mov r3, 10
    call func_that_uses_r3
    cmp r3, 10                  ; will set the compare flag


Passing arguments can happen in either registers or the stack, depending on the
size and amount of arguments. If an argument fits in a register, it is passed
in one starting from r0, up to r3. If the argument is larger than 16 bits,
a struct for example, it is passed on the stack.

It is important to remember that Irid defines the stack pointers (sp & bp) to
be callee-saved, meaning the stack cannot change after a call. When writing
a public subroutine that may interact with other code you don't know about,
it is good practice to place a preamble and an epilogue at each end.

    ; Preamble
    push bp
    mov bp, sp

    ; ... code ...

    ; Epilogue
    mov sp, bp
    pop bp
    ret

These operations can be made nicer with macros. Each of these registers is two
bytes wide, so the total amount of "preamble" data is 10 bytes. When reading
an argument off the stack, 10 bytes have to be added to reach it.


CPU call
--------

When the program runs the `cpucall` instruction, the CPU will read the r0
register to identify what function must it run before it returns to the program.
Using a CPU call you can map memory to a certain device or shut down the CPU.
All parameters are passed in the general registers, starting from r0.

0x10
    Shut down the CPU. This will stop execution immediately.

0x11
    Restart the CPU, resetting all registers & jumping to 0x0000.

0x12
    Force a CPU fault.

0x13
    | r1: pointer to u16[]
    | r2: array capacity
    Query the device IDs. Provide a pointer to an array in r1, and the length
    of the array in r2. The CPU will then fill the u16[] array with device IDs
    and set the amount of devices back in r2.

0x14
    | r1: device ID
    | r2: pointer to device info struct
    Query the device info.

0x15
    | r1: device ID
    | r2: pointer to the handler function
    Install a handler which gets called when a byte can be read. Note that this
    will call the function in interrupt mode, meaning the user has to return
    using rti, not ret. CPU interrupts must be also enabled. The pointer to the
    handler function cannot be 0x0000.

0x20
    | r1: device ID
    | h2: byte to write
    Write a byte stored in h2 to the device defined in r1.

0x21
    | r1: device ID
    Read a byte to h2 from the device defined in r1.

0x22
    | r1: device ID
    Poll a device if it has any data to read, and return a bool value in h2.
