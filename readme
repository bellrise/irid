Irid
====

This is the Irid mono-repo with all things Irid. Irid is a custom, 16-bit
architecture built for fun and learning purposes. This project contains the
emulator, assembler and linker for the custom assembly language, which frankly
is simmilar to existing assemblies.


Build
-----

To compile this whole project, the only requirements are a sane C compiler,
and GNU Make. Optionally, you may use Python 3 for scripts (not required to
build). All you have to run is:

$ make
