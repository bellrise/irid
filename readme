Irid
====

Irid is a custom, 16-bit architecture built for fun and learning purposes. This
project has a special emulator built-in, which will create a X11 window to draw
the pixels set by any software that's running on the emulator, written using the
Irid instruction set.


Build
-----

To compile this whole project, the only requirements are a sane C compiler,
and GNU Make. Optionally, you may use Python 3 for scripts (not required to
build). All you have to run is:

$ make
